Save 9gag posts by upvoting them.

I love saving memes on the phone. 
But it's difficult to do the same easily on a laptop. 
So I made a Chrome extension to help me do it whenever I upvote something.

Future expansions:
- Custom downloads folder (now saves to the Chrome downloads folder)
- Have integrations to typical notes applications
